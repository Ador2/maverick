* add more tests to get better code coverage

* init.pp: add params to create jails/filters/actions with hashes (pass them on
  to create_resources with the already present defined types). This will make
  it possible for folks to use hiera to define them.

* symlinks are not allowed in "puppet module build". need to find another way
  to have a test setup that works
