# Web Module

The Web module adds a web interface and web services to Maverick.  It is currently in very early stages, and a temporary (not very pretty!) webpage index is in place.  However, there is an emerging structure in place and great things planned for the future, including a web configuration front-end for Maverick and a rich web based GCS and realtime video interface.

This module is under active construction, this page will be updated shortly.
