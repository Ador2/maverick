# Developer Documentation

This section is for developer documentation, that is developers or 'power users' of Maverick.  It is a bit sparse and not very structured, and will be formalised at a later date.

 - [How to compile code using Maverick software components](/dev/compiling)  
 - [How to create Distribution Images of Maverick](/dev/distimages)
